Troubleshooting guide

# Generic guide
Usually no matter what issue you ran into, please run the [sanity check and collect basic info](sanity_check_and_collect_basic_info.md) firstly.

If you ran into `etcdserver: mvcc: database space exceeded` issue, or has a very big `${etcd-data-dir}/member/snap/db` file, please follow [How to debug large db size issue](how_to_debug_large_db_size_issue.md).

If you ran into performance issue, please follow [How to debug performance issue](how_to_debug_performance_issue.md).

# Anything else?
Please let me know if anyone has any thoughts on how to improve this guide. 
Contribution is welcome!
